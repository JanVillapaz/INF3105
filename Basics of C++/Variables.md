# Initialization of variables

When variables are declared, they have an undetermined value until they are assigned a value for the first time. But this is possible for a variable to have a specific value from the moment it is declared. This is called `initialization` of the variable.

In C++ there are three ways to initialize variables. They are all equivalent and are reminiscent of the evolution of the language over the years:

The first one, known as `c-like initialization` (because it is inherited from the C language), consists of appending an equal sign followed by the value to which the variable is initialized.
